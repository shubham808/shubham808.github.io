In March 2016, DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated 18 time World Champion and Nine Dan Go player(that's the highest rank there is in Go) Lee Sedol.

That was a breakthrough moment for Deep Learning. Go is an abstract strategy game with fairly simple rules but an enormous complexity, that goes much beyond chess. The possible number of moves in any game is statastically more than the total number of atoms in the visible universe.

The event thus marked the first time a machine had beaten the very best at this ancient and enormously complex gameâ€”a feat that, until recently, experts didn't expect would happen for another ten years.

Deep Learning is on a rise. Everyday we hear a tech giants releasing powerfull deep learning libraries and the next day we hear even bigger giants buying smart deep learning startups as billion dollars deals.
